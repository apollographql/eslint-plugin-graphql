### v3.0.1

- Fix support for multi-schema workspaces [PR #179](https://github.com/apollographql/eslint-plugin-graphql/pull/179) by [Pat Sissons](https://github.com/patsissons)

### v3.0.0

- BREAKING: The `required-fields` rule has been significantly changed to make it a completely reliable method of ensuring an `id` field (or any other field name) is always requested when available. [PR #199](https://github.com/apollographql/eslint-plugin-graphql/pull/199) Here is the behavior, let's say we are requiring field `id`:
  - On any field whose return type defines a field called `id`, the selection set must directly contain `id`.
  - In any named fragment declaration whose type defines a field called `id`, the selection set must directly contain `id`.
  - An inline fragment whose type defines a field called `id` must contain `id` in its selection set unless its parent is also an inline fragment that contains the field `id`.
  - Here's a specific case which is _no longer valid_:
    - `query { greetings { hello ... on Greetings { id } } }`
    - This must now be written as `query { greetings { id hello ... on Greetings { id } } }`
  - This is a more conservative approach than before, driven by the fact that it's quite hard to ensure that a combination of inline fragments actually covers all of the possible types of a selection set.
- Fix breaking change in `graphql@^14.0.0` that renamed `ProvidedNonNullArguments` to `ProvidedRequiredArguments` [#192](https://github.com/apollographql/eslint-plugin-graphql/pull/192)
